### Name Selection
* Relative Strength
* Volume -- Pocket Pivot or Very high Volume
* Liquidity 

### Little Tricks
* Inside Bars
* Pivot Low Failures (2B reversals) (Victor Sperandeo)
* Outside Reversals
* Candlestick Patterns (Steve Nison)
* Too Tight for Too Long (Traps)
* Fade your emotion
* Rising Trendline

* Buying and Selling in pieces
  Initial buy 1000 shares at $50, Stop of $2 at 48
  Next buy point shows up at $55. 
  Buy additional 1000 shares with $2 risk and set stop for the _entire position_ at $53.
  now we have risked $2000 from the profits from the original trade.
  so if we get stopped out, we still have $3K - $2K.
