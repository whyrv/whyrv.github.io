# Hello and welcome  

## My first attempt at a trading journal

### 
_from @greddsports_

    Favorite rule:
    No trades allowed that weren’t pre-planned and already written in my journal 

    - ensures I do my nightly/premarket routine to a T
    - ensures no emotions intraday can cause irrational decisions 

    If stock goes without me I was:
    1) unprepared
    2) didn’t want trade
